package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	// defers will not be run when using os.Exit, so this fmt.Println will never be called.
	defer fmt.Println("!")

	// os.Exit() immediately exits the program
	os.Exit(3)
}

// Note that unlike e.g. C, Go does not use an integer return value
// from main() to indicate exit status.
// If youâ€™d like to exit with a non-zero status you should use os.Exit.

// If you run exit.go using go run, the exit will be picked up by go and printed.
// By building and executing a binary you can see the status in the terminal (There is, however, NO stdout output)
