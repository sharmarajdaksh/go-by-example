// A panic typically means something went unexpectedly wrong.
// Mostly we use it to fail fast on errors that shouldn’t
// occur during normal operation,
// or that we aren’t prepared to handle gracefully.

func main() {

	// We’ll use panic throughout this site to check for unexpected errors.
	// This is the only program on the site designed to panic.
	panic("a problem")

	// A common use of panic is to abort if a function
	// returns an error value that we don’t know how to (or want to) handle.
	_, err := os.Create("/tmp/file")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Running this program will cause it to panic,
	// print an error message and goroutine traces, and exit with a non-zero status.
}

// Note that unlike some languages which use exceptions
// for handling of many errors, in Go it is idiomatic
// to use error-indicating return values wherever possible.
